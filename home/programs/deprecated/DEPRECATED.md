- I like EWW but I haven't updated my config for Hyprland yet.
- Ironbar feels like it needs a lot more time to develop before it's easy to use and bug free. It is exciting though!
- Kitty doesn't support Monaspace Xenon without messing around with font rendering stuff, so I'm using Alacritty. Have not noticed a difference yet sooo
